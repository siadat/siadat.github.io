Some ideas about things that could improve about my current blogging flow are:

* Generate HTML files using Github actions.
* A command for creating a new post with today's date.
* Upload images in another repository or file hosting service.
* I don't like the fact that I have to git-commit and think of a name for the new post.

My goal is to streamline the process of creating and publishing multiple posts per day,
making it as simple and efficient as possible.
