    [Kilobot][paper_kilobot]
    (created by Prof. Radhika Nagpal and Prof. Michael Rubenstein)
    is a programmable robot developed in order to facilitate the research of **decentralized,
    multi-hop, and asynchronous cooperative** agents constituting a swarm. The challenge
    is to design local rules in such a way that a desired global behavior is attained.
    
    All interactions are purely local. The robots are capable of sending messages
    to their neighbors, measuring ambient light, and they have vibrating motors
    allowing them to turn and move straight. The robots have no sensor for their
    position or orientation. To localize, we need to program a distributed localization
    algorithm e.g., calculate relative positions to a few pre-localized neighbors
    using triangulation, preferably with robots that make a robust quadrilateral
    as described in [this paper](http://rvsn.csail.mit.edu/netloc/sensys04.pdf).
    
    I developed a Kilobot swarm simulator library to reproduce several experiments
    published by [Self-Organizing Systems Research Group](https://ssr.seas.harvard.edu/kilobots).
    I took a combination of Object-Oriented and Data-Oriented design approaches for better performance.
    
    Furthermore, I designed and implemented two new algorithms; a self-replicating algorithm and a routing algorithm.

    Here's a list of the algorithms I have implemented or designed:

    - **Self-replicating** (new experiment)
      [<i class="fas fa-play-circle"></i> Run][exp_replicator_starfish] (starfish),
      [<i class="fas fa-play-circle"></i> Run][exp_replicator_asymmetric] (asymmetric shape).

        The goal of this algorithm is to construct replicas of a given shape as
        specified by a subset of the robots. For example, to create a starfish
        shape, I manually place a number of robots to form the shape of one hand
        and let the algorithm replicate it 4 times to get a total of 5 hands.
        To see it in action, [<i class="fas fa-play-circle"></i> Run][exp_replicator_starfish] the algorithm on your browser.

    - **Network routing** (new experiment)
      [<i class="fas fa-play-circle"></i> Run][exp_bellmanford].

        Because of the decentralized, multi-hop, and asynchronous nature of their communication, Kilobots have similarities to computer networks.
        In this experiment the swarm acts like a network in which each node is linked to its adjacent neighbors.
        The robots run a [distributed distance-vector protocol routing][wikipedia_distance_vector] algorithm.
        In their hexagonal grid, each robot has a maximum of 6 adjacent neighbors, which act like network links.
        The link cost is the distance between the two robots.
        Messages are either advertised to all adjacent robots, or to a specific link (All messages are technically broadcast, however, if the message has a "link" parameter, it is discarded by all robots except the robot with the matching link identifier).
        Initially, the end-point robots (i.e., the colored ones) advertise themselves as end-points.
        Whenever a robot receives this advertisment, they store this value to their routing table.
        Finally, once a advertised end-point reaches another, they start sending periodic messages to all the end-points they are aware of.
    
    - **Self-assembly**
      [<i class="fas fa-play-circle"></i> Run][exp_assembly_wrench] (wrench),
      [<i class="fas fa-play-circle"></i> Run][exp_assembly_starfish] (starfish),
      [paper][paper_assembly] published in Science.

    - **Disassembly**
      [<i class="fas fa-play-circle"></i> Run][exp_disassembly],
      [paper][paper_disassembly].
    
    - **Gradient formation**

      [paper][paper_gradient].
    
    - **Sync**

      [paper][paper_kilobot].
    
    - **Follow the leader**
      [<i class="fas fa-play-circle"></i> Run][exp_follow_the_leader],
      [paper][paper_kilobot].
    
    - **Phototaxis** and **antiphototaxis**
      [<i class="fas fa-play-circle"></i> Run][exp_phototaxis] (one light),
      [<i class="fas fa-play-circle"></i> Run][exp_phototaxis2] (two lights),
      [paper][paper_kilobot].

    The backend servers and cross-platform frontend of an online multiplayer
    turn-based game that is composed of several microservices, making it
    highly available. It is designed with scalability in mind from the start.

    I built a service that ran the game logic (including deterministic physics simulation) to make sure clients do not cheat.
    Another essential service was the match-maker, which initiated games for users who requested to start a game.

    All these services were **stateless** allowing them to be replicated on several servers for higher availability.
    These components communicated via a **message queue**,
    which made sure that no game state was corrupted or lost even if the game services are temporarily down, treating them as cattle rather than pets.

    While I was at Sariina, I worked on the statistics and lottery program of a
    **live television show** that was broadcast during all the World Cup and
    derby football matches.  The television program, Navad
    ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navad)), was one of the most
    watched and loved national television show in the country.  Our lead
    designer, has written a [blog post][farzan_post] elaborating about the
    graphics of the project.
