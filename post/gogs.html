      <section itemprop="entry-text">
        <p>Until yesterday, we used GitLab at work. GitLab is a great project and it has tones of features. But our GitLab server is a small virtual machine with only 2GB of RAM. We had constant issues with high RAM usage, so much that it would reject some pushes and fetches.</p>

<p>Last night we installed Gogs as a replacement for GitLab. <a href="http://gogs.io">Gogs</a> is a GitHub-like self-hosted git service written in Go.</p>

<p>The installation was very painless.  We decided to use the existing domain, url and ports, so the team members wouldn&rsquo;t have to update their remote urls.  The most time consuming step was the migration of existing GitLab repositories. I placed the bare repositories created by GitLab and used the migration tool built in Gogs.</p>

<hr />

<p>After migrating existing repositories, I would receive a 500 error when viewing some of the repositories.
There was an error in the <code>GetBranch</code> function.
Gogs did not expect migrated repositories to be empty.
There are many ways to find out if a repository is empty. Using either the <code>log</code> command:</p>

<pre><code>$ git log -1
fatal: bad default revision 'HEAD'
$ echo $?
128
</code></pre>

<p>or the <code>rev-parse</code> command:</p>

<pre><code>$ git rev-parse --verify HEAD
fatal: Needed a single revision
$ echo $?
128
</code></pre>

<p>I fixed the error with the help of @Unknown and the <a href="https://github.com/gogits/gogs/pull/1589">patch</a> is now merged on the develop branch of Gogs.</p>

<hr />

<p>The overall experience was very positive. The project maintainer is very welcoming and supportive. I highly recommend using Gogs and making contributions to it.</p>
