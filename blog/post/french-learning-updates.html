      <h1 class="entry-title" itemprop="headline">French language learning update for April 2023</h1>
      <section itemprop="entry-text">
        <p>I started listening to French standup comedians, e.g. <a href="https://montreuxcomedy.com/fr/la-chaine" target="_blank">Montreux Comedy</a>. I don&rsquo;t understand 98% of what they say, but sometimes I hear some words that I know. I feel that it is useful to familiarise myself with how natives speak.</p>

<h2>Why standup comedy?</h2>

<p>I was watching a video by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Tohideh" target="_blank">Tohideh French</a>. She is my favourite French teacher and content creator on Youtube and Instagram. She said a few points that I had already heard but never put into practice or thought about for more than a few seconds until after watching her video:</p>

<ul>
<li>Consume content that you <em>enjoy</em>.</li>
<li>Consume content for <em>native speakrs</em>, even if you don&rsquo;t understand.</li>
</ul>

<p>In her video about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmvvpEyr-mE&amp;t=908s" target="_blank">French resource recommendations</a>, she recommends different kinds of resources, TV series, podcasts, etc and encourages learners to see which one they enjoy the most. I tried some of them, but I didn&rsquo;t see myself wanting to go back to most of them. But then she listed a few comedy Youtube channels, including Montreux Comedy! I watched a few seconds and for some reason, that hit me in the right place. I love comedy, it&rsquo;s my go-to genre on Netflix when I need something to watch. This is definitely something I can go back to again. I can even rewatch the same videos.</p>

<p>I have watched the videos on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL40TWjlepv_o8SBm7MBz7bT7rW-sTTfUY" target="_blank">Le RÃ©pondeur de Montreux Comedy playlist</a> a few times so far.</p>

<p>The thing that makes me happy is that it doesn&rsquo;t make me feed bad when I don&rsquo;t understand them. Something is in the right place in my mindset, I hope the mindset persists :)</p>

<p>Reading the French comments is fun as well. I first try to understand the comment, then confirm my understanding with the very convenient &ldquo;Translate to English&rdquo; button. Reading Youtube comments is generally a positive experience, so it helps!</p>

<h2>Doully</h2>

<p>I have watched a couple of videos by Doully. She has a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U720kk2m7kw" target="_blank">video</a> in which she talks about <em>vit avec un handicap invisible</em>.</p>

<p>I might explore videos by <a href="https://www.konbini.com/categorie/videos/" target="_blank">Konbini</a> later as well, they have a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U720kk2m7kw" target="_blank">video by Doully</a> which was good to listen to (saying as someone who didn&rsquo;t understand 98% of it lol).</p>

## New words

I don't plan to revise these words, I might forget them, also the meanings might be wrong, but just the act of writing them forces me to revise them once, so here we go :)
