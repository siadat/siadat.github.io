      <section itemprop="entry-text">
        <p>I haven&rsquo;t blogged here since 2020. I&rsquo;d like to try to blog more frequently.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m inspired by Simon Willison&rsquo;s <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/Apr/8/working-in-public/" target="_blank">blog</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnz3uJw1DNo&amp;t=2296s" target="_blank">interview</a> about working in public:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve set myself a rule that anytime I do a project, the price for doing that project is I have to write about it. This is good for me because I&rsquo;m very easily distracted: I can get to the end of the day and I had an idea for a project and I built it and that wasn&rsquo;t on my list but at least now I have to pay for it and the payment is I have to write it up.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I will write just for me and for holding myself accountable when I work on projects. It&rsquo;s also nice to be able to look back and see the projects I have worked on in one place. When I don&rsquo;t publish a writing about a project, it is as if it has never happened. Even I will eventually forget about it a couple of years later.</p>

<p>A few things I&rsquo;d like to keep in mind this time:</p>

<ul>
<li>It doesn&rsquo;t matter which platform I use. I&rsquo;m using my existing tools because it already works and it&rsquo;s free, even though I had to fix a few things here and there.</li>
<li>Frequency is my priority right now. I will try my best to avoid falling into the quality trap.</li>
<li>Writing and screenshots last longer than code.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some ideas about things that could improve about my current blogging flow are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Build HTML files in a Github action.</li>
<li>A command for creating a new post with today&rsquo;s date.</li>
<li>Upload images in another repository or file hosting service.</li>
<li>I don&rsquo;t like the fact that I have to git-commit and think of a name for the new post.</li>
</ul>

<p>I&rsquo;d like to be able create several posts each day. It should be easy to create a new post and publish it quickly.</p>
