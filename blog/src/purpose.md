In the [Grit](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Grit-Passion-Perseverance-Angela-Duckworth/dp/1501111108) book, there's a chapter, Chapter 8 Purpose, dedicated to exploring the subject and meaning of "purpose".  The following sentence resonated with me the most:

> At its core, the idea of purpose is the idea that what we do matters to people other than ourselves.
