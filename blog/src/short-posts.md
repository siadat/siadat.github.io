## What is a short post?

They won't appear in the main list of blog posts,
and not in the generated RSS xml file.

I am separating these posts from main blog posts, because I want to remove the mental resistance for writing and publishing online. I'd like to maintain a relatively high quality for the main blog posts without discouraging myself from writing whatever I want.

Also, I'd rather keep the main posts about software engineering.

## Why "short"?

I also find it useful to think of these posts as tweets.
I first called it a "tweet", but then thought it might be confusing with Twitter tweets, so I renamed it to shorts.

The idea for this kind of posts started as something like TIL posts, but not just TILs.
Something like tweets but not necessarily short. Oops.

All the "short" posts start as small ideas. The goal is to reduce the barrier to entry (for writing). I'm going to keep calling it "short" for now, until I come up with a more descriptive name.

## What next?

I might edit these posts, improve them and "graduate" them to the main blog. I wonder if that would be a good idea. Time will tell lol.
