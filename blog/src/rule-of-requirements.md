title: Rule of Requirements

A requirement document is a written summary of the communications and
negotations between a customer and a developer.

It could be in the form of a summary of agreements, or it could be a history of
chat messages exchanged between a developer and a customer.

Here are my guidelines for ensuring the rule of requirements in the development of software systems:

- The requirement is the authorative source for the implementation of the project.
  Neither the customer nor the developer can impose their interest to the other without due process.
  The final word should be in the requirement, and anything outside the scope should either be avoided or included via negotiation.

- Neither the customer nor the developer is allowed to make any changes to the
  requirement without obtaining the consensus of the other party.

- All ambiguities about a feature should be resolved by the requirement, as opposed to one party's discretion.

- Requirements should cover all features of the system.

- The developer should be given necessary access and resources to perform its job.
  This includes access to the requirement, the customer, the users, and the right to negotiate changes.

- The features specified in the requirements must be feasible for the developer to execute.

- The developer and the customer must communicate and perform their required task professionally and bona fides.
