A requirement document must have the highest influence on how the project is implemented.
It corresponds to, I believe, a collection of laws in a community in which the "Rule of Law" is upheld as sacrosanct.
In this sense, writing a requirement document is akin to devising a set of laws for a small society comprising, in the simplest case, a developer and a customer. 

In its most basic form, a requirement document is the communications between a customer and a developer in written form.
It should include a compacted summary of final agreements.

Here are my guidelines for maintaining the "Rule of Requirements" during the development of a software system:

- The requirement is the authoritative source for decisions regarding the implementation of the project.
  Neither the customer nor the developer can impose their interest to the other without due process.
  The final word should be in the requirement, and anything outside the scope should either be avoided or included via negotiation.

- Neither the customer nor the developer is allowed to make any changes to the
  requirement without obtaining the consensus of the other party.

- All ambiguities about a feature should be resolved by the requirement, as opposed to one party's discretion.

- Requirements should cover all features of the system.

- The developer should be given necessary access and resources to perform its job.
  This includes access to the requirement, the customer, the users, and the right to negotiate changes.

- The features specified in the requirements must be feasible for the developer to execute.

- The developer and the customer must communicate and perform their required task professionally and bona fides.
