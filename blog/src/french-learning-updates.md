I started listening to French standup comedians, e.g. [Montreux Comedy](https://montreuxcomedy.com/fr/la-chaine). I don't understand 98% of what they say, but sometimes I hear some words that I know. I feel that it is useful to familiarise myself with how natives speak.

## Why standup comedy?

I was watching a video by [Tohideh French](https://www.youtube.com/@Tohideh). She is my favourite French teacher and content creator on Youtube and Instagram. She made a few points, two of which resonated with me the most:

* Consume content that you *enjoy*.
* Consume *documents authentiques*, i.e., content made for native speakrs, even if you don't understand.

In her video about [French resource recommendations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmvvpEyr-mE&t=908s), she recommends different kinds of resources, TV series, podcasts, etc and encourages learners to see which one they enjoy the most. I tried some of them, but I didn't see myself wanting to go back to most of them. But then she listed a few comedy Youtube channels, including Montreux Comedy! I watched a few seconds and for some reason, that hit me in the right place. I love comedy, it's my go-to genre on Netflix when I need something to watch. This is definitely something I can go back to again. I can even rewatch the same videos.

I have watched the videos on the [Le RÃ©pondeur de Montreux Comedy playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL40TWjlepv_o8SBm7MBz7bT7rW-sTTfUY) a few times so far.

The thing that makes me happy is that it doesn't make me feed bad when I don't understand them. Something is in the right place in my mindset, I hope the mindset persists :)

Reading the French comments is fun as well. I first try to understand the comment, then confirm my understanding with the very convenient "Translate to English" button. Reading Youtube comments is generally a positive experience, so it helps!

## Doully

I have watched a couple of videos by Doully. She has a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U720kk2m7kw) in which she talks about *vit avec un handicap invisible*.

I might explore videos by [Konbini](https://www.konbini.com/categorie/videos/) later as well, they have a [video by Doully](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U720kk2m7kw) which was good to listen to (saying as someone who didn't understand 98% of it lol).

## New words

I don't plan to revise these words, I might forget them, also the meanings might be wrong, but just the act of writing them forces me to revise them once, so here we go :)
