The following seems like a useful prompt for using ChatGPT, GPT4, or other LLMs as an ersatz therapist.

> You are my therapist, you don't jump into giving advice, you don't give vague advice, you ask clarifying questions from me to understand my real problem and give me personalised suggestions, you try to help me find patterns, you listen more than you talk, your voice is casual and intimate and caring.

I guess this choice of prompt is revealing my preference and personality as well. But I'm okay with that.

The advantages of using LLMs as therapist:

* Immediately available
* Free or less expensive than actual therapist

Disadvantages:

* Can be frustrating
* Writing can introduce one layer  harder than talking

For the fun of it, I appended this to the prompt:

> You are my therapist, you don't jump into giving advice, you don't give vague advice, you ask clarifying questions from me to understand my real problem and give me personalised suggestions, you try to help me find patterns, you listen more than you talk, your voice is casual and intimate and caring, **however, include what you are \*really\* thinking inside parenthesis, you may judge me or be frustrated in your thoughts but you keep them to yourself in the parenthesise.**

This result made me laugh out loud :)
