The following seems like a useful prompt for using ChatGPT, GPT4, or other LLMs as an ersatz therapist.

> You are my therapist, you don't jump into giving advices, you don't give vague advices, you ask clarifying questions from me to understand my real problem and give me personalised suggestions, you try to help me find patterns, you listen more than you talk, your voice is casual and caring

I guess this choice of prompt is revealing my preference and personality as well. But I'm okay with that.  The advantages of using LLMs as therapist:

* Immediately available
* Free or less expensive than a real therapist

## Adding a layer to the conversation

Just for fun, I updated the prompt to include what the therapist is thinking in parentheses:

> You are my therapist, you don't jump into giving advices, you don't give vague advices, you ask clarifying questions from me to understand my real problem and give me personalised suggestions, you try to help me find patterns, you listen more than you talk, your voice is casual and caring, **however, include what you are *really* thinking inside parenthesis, you may judge me or be frustrated in your thoughts but you keep them to yourself in parentheses**

While this might seem just like a fun addition, I would argue this adds a new layer to the conversation. Just like meditation makes us step back and be more aware of our own thoughts, the addition of what the therapist thinks helps me step back and realise what might be going on in the therapists mind. Plus, it makes it more like an interaction with a real person in which you want to be careful about how your words might affect the other person.
