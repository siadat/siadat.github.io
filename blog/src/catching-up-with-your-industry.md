In an interview with Yelp's blog, [Daniel says](https://blog.yelp.com/life-at-yelp/a-day-in-the-life-of-a-software-engineer-at-yelp/):

> I usually start the day by catching up on security news, in the form of things like **podcasts** and **news articles** and reflecting on how Yelpâ€™s security posture stacks against the real-life events happening in the industry.

Daniel is an amazing engineer and I try to learn anything I can from him. So, I take note:

* News articles
* Podcasts

I think these are the best way to keep up with the latest trends in most industries.

**News articles** are important because they help you discover new trends you'd otherwise miss.

**Podcasts** are super useful because they often explain terminologies and challenges in an easy to understand way. Talking in a podcast interview is the easiest way an expert could generate content. It is easier than video (which requires a whole set of decisions that can be overwhelming), and it is even easier than writing a blog post for the expert. For the podcast, the expert needs to just show up to the interview. 

Books take years to write. While they are valuable for consolidating a huge amount of wisdome into one coherent piece, they are a few years behind blogs, news and podcasts.

## Introspection

* My industry is databaes, I need to find and listen to more podcasts about it.
* I use Google Podcast, but not many podcasts link to it. I might switch to Spotify. The playback is very quick.
* Hacker News is not really a good news source for a specific industry. It's great for learning, exploring and keeping up to date with *general* news.
* The News page of [InfoQ](https://www.infoq.com/news/) has categories for different industries. It includes [Databases](https://www.infoq.com/database) and even a [NoSQL](https://www.infoq.com/nosql/) category.
