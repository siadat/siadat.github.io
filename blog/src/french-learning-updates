I started listening to French standup comedians, e.g. [Montreux Comedy](https://montreuxcomedy.com/fr/la-chaine). I don't understand 98% of what they say, but sometimes I hear some words that I know. I feel that it is useful to familiarise myself with how natives speak.

## Why standup comedy?

I was watching a video by [Tohideh French](https://www.youtube.com/@Tohideh), she said a few points that I already knew but never put into practice or thought about for more than a few seconds:

* Consume content that you enjoy.
* Consume content for native speakrs, even if you don't understand.

In [her video about resource materials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmvvpEyr-mE&t=908s), she recommends different kinds of resources, TV series, podcasts, etc. I tried some of them, but I didn't see myself wanting to go back to them. But then she listed a few comedy Youtube channels, including Montreux Comedy! For some reason, that hit me in the right place. I love comedy, it's my go-to genre on Netflix when I need something to watch.

The thing that makes me happy is that it doesn't make me feed bad when I don't understand them. Something is in the right place in my mindset, I hope the mindset persists :)

I find the [Le RÃ©pondeur de Montreux Comedy](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL40TWjlepv_o8SBm7MBz7bT7rW-sTTfUY) is a good listening practice as well.

Also, reading the French comments feels like fun. I first try to understand the comment, then confirm my understanding (and check words) with the very convenient "Translate to English" button. It helps that lots of them are funny or help me understand the content of the video.

## Doully

I have watched a couple of videos by Doully. She has a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U720kk2m7kw) in which she talks about *vit avec un handicap invisible*.

I might explore videos by [Konbini](https://www.konbini.com/categorie/videos/) later as well, they have a talking head [video by Doully](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U720kk2m7kw) which was good to listen to (saying as someone who didn't understand 98% of it lol).

## New words

I don't plan to revise these words, I might forget them, also the meanings might be wrong, but just the act of writing them forces me to revise them once, so here we go :)
