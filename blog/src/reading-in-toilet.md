Lots of people take their phones to the toilet with them.
It's been about two weeks that I have stopped doing that.
I have placed a paperback book in the toilet.
I never take the book outside the toilet. I have an epub version of it in case I need to continue reading it elsewhere, but the paperback stays in the toilet.

This has improved by reading time during during weekdays.

The paperback I'm currently reading is [Grit](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Grit-Vermilion-Essentials-Angela-Duckworth/dp/1785042661/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=). I bought it 3 weeks ago from a train station. I might publish what I think about the book later.
