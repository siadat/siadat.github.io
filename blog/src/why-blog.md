I haven't blogged here since 2020. I'd like to try to blog more frequently.

I'm inspired by Simon Willison's [blog](https://simonwillison.net/2023/Apr/8/working-in-public/) and [interview on Youtube](https://youtu.be/Rnz3uJw1DNo?t=2276) about working in public. Here are my key takeaways from his insights:

* Set aside a 30-minute window (e.g., 9:00 to 9:30 AM) to plan the day, focusing on one major task and two smaller ones. Review progress at day's end, and assess larger goals weekly. This is for when things are going smoothly.
* Recognize that, while productivity is important, there will be inevitable deviations from original plans. It's a continuous challenge, even for highly productive individuals like Simon.
* You could begin by writing TILs posts about simple topics, like for-loops in Bash. This approach helps to manage expectations and prevent writer's block, as the content isn't intended to be groundbreaking.
* Implement a rule that, for every unplanned project undertaken, a corresponding blog post must be published.
* Writing and screenshots last longer than code.

I'd like to have a record of the projects I have worked on, and also hold myself accountable for them. When I don't publish a writing about a project, eventually it will fade away from my memory as if I never worked on them.

As I dive back into blogging, I'll keep a few guiding principles in mind:

* I'm not aiming to revolutionize anyone's world with my writing; I primarily write for myself.
* It doesn't matter which platform I use. I'm using my existing tools because it already works, despite occasional issues, and it's free.
* Frequency is my priority for this blog. I will try my best to avoid falling into the quality trap.

That's it for now :)
