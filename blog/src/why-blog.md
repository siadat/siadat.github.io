title: Why blog

I haven't blogged here since 2020. I'd like to try to blog more frequently.

A few things I'd like to keep in mind this time:

* It doesn't matter which platform I use. I'm using my existing tools because it already works, even though I had to fix a few things here and there. It is not perfect, but it works for now and it is free.
* I want to keep the bar low for quality and insight. Frequency is my priority right now.
* This is just for me and for holding myself accountable when I work on projects.


Some ideas about things that could improve about my current blogging flow are:

* Build HTML files in a Github action.
* A command for creating a new post with today's date.
* Upload images in another repository or file hosting service.

I'd like to be able create several posts each day. It should be easy to create a new post and publish it quickly.
