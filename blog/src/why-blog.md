title: Why blog

I haven't blogged here since 2020. I'd like to try to blog more frequently. I'm inspired by Simon Willison's [blog](https://simonwillison.net/2023/Apr/8/working-in-public/) and [interview on Youtube](https://youtu.be/Rnz3uJw1DNo?t=2276) about working in public. Here are my key takeaways from his insights:

* Set aside a 30-minute window (e.g., 9:00 to 9:30 AM) to plan the day, focusing on one major task and two smaller ones. Review progress at day's end, and assess larger goals weekly â€“ when things are going smoothly.
* Recognize that, while productivity is important, there will be inevitable deviations from original plans. It's a continuous challenge, even for highly productive individuals like Simon.
* Begin by writing TILs posts about simple topics, like for-loops in Bash. This approach helps to manage expectations and prevent writer's block, as the content isn't intended to be groundbreaking.
* Implement a rule that, for every unplanned project undertaken, a corresponding blog post must be published.

My motivation for blogging stems from personal accountability and the desire to have a record of my past projects. When I don't document a project, it feels as though it never occurred, eventually fading from my memory.

I'm not aiming to revolutionize anyone's world with my writing; I primarily write for myself. As I dive back into blogging, I'll keep a few guiding principles in mind:

* It doesn't matter which platform I use. I'm using my existing tools because it already works and it's free, despite occasional issues.
* Frequency is my priority right now. I will try my best to avoid falling into the quality trap.
* Writing and screenshots last longer than code.

Some ideas about things that could improve about my current blogging flow are:

* Generate HTML files using Github actions.
* A command for creating a new post with today's date.
* Upload images in another repository or file hosting service.
* I don't like the fact that I have to git-commit and think of a name for the new post.

My goal is to streamline the process of creating and publishing multiple posts per day, making it as simple and efficient as possible.
