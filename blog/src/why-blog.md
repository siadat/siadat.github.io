I haven't blogged here since 2020. I'd like to try to blog more frequently.

I'm inspired by Simon Willison's [blog](https://simonwillison.net/2023/Apr/8/working-in-public/) and [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnz3uJw1DNo&t=2296s) about working in public:

> I've set myself a rule that anytime I do a project, the price for doing that project is I have to write about it. This is good for me because I'm very easily distracted: I can get to the end of the day and I had an idea for a project and I built it and that wasn't on my list but at least now I have to pay for it and the payment is I have to write it up.

I will write just for me and for holding myself accountable when I work on projects. It's also nice to be able to look back and see the projects I have worked on in one place. When I don't publish a writing about a project, it is as if it has never happened. Even I will eventually forget about it a couple of years later.

A few things I'd like to keep in mind this time:

* It doesn't matter which platform I use. I'm using my existing tools because it already works and it's free, even though I had to fix a few things here and there.
* Frequency is my priority right now. I will try my best to avoid falling into the quality trap.
* Writing and screenshots last longer than code.


Some ideas about things that could improve about my current blogging flow are:

* Build HTML files in a Github action.
* A command for creating a new post with today's date.
* Upload images in another repository or file hosting service.
* I don't like the fact that I have to git-commit and think of a name for the new post.

I'd like to be able create several posts each day. It should be easy to create a new post and publish it quickly.
