The challenge is to design local rules in such a way that a desired global behavior is attained.\n\nAll interactions are purely local. The robots are capable of sending messages to their neighbors, measuring ambient light, and they have vibrating motors allowing them to turn and move straight. The robots have no sensor for their position or orientation. To localize, we need to program a distributed localization algorithm e.g., calculate relative positions to a few pre-localized neighbors using triangulation, preferably with robots that make a robust quadrilateral as described in [this paper](http://rvsn.csail.mit.edu/netloc/sensys04.pdf).\n\nI developed a Kilobot swarm simulator library to reproduce several experiments published by [Self-Organizing Systems Research Group](https://ssr.seas.harvard.edu/kilobots).\n\nFurthermore, I designed and implemented a new self-replicating algorithm. The goal of this algorithm is to construct replicas of a given shape as specified by a subset of the robots. For example, to create a starfish shape, I manually place a number of robots to form the shape of one hand and let the algorithm replicate it 4 times to get a total of 5 hands. To see it in action, you can [run](/kilobots/index.html?ExperimentReplicatorStarfish) the algorithm on your browser.\n\nI have implemented several of the published algorithm:\n\n- **Self-assembly**: [➤ Run (wrench shape)](/kilobots/index.html?ExperimentAssembly), [➤ Run (starfish)](/kilobots/index.html?ExperimentAssemblyStarfish).
