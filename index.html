<div class="about">
<ul>
<li>I am a freelance software engineer and consultant.</li>
<li>I teach the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(programming_language)">Go programming language</a> to developers at companies
  and researchers at universities. I have made a number of contributions to the language.</li>
<li>As a backend engineer, I have worked on highly concurrent messaging systems, financial and payment systems,
  lottery campaigns, authorization systems, highly responsive game servers, and other APIs.
  I use languages such as Go, C++, Ruby, and tools like Kubernetes, Docker, Kafka, Qemu, etc.</li>
<li>As a frontend engineer, I have developed an interactive interface for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navad">Navad</a>.
  The app was used and broadcast <strong>live on national television</strong> during all the World Cup and derby football matches.
  I have also developed several mobile games and progressive web apps.
  Technologies I have used include Javascript, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flutter_(software)">Flutter</a>, Lua and my custom-built game engine.</li>
<li>Previously, I worked as an infrastructure engineer at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cafe_Bazaar">Cafe Bazaar</a>.
  I was involved in building the <strong>on-premises Kubernetes</strong> infrastructure and migrating existing services to microservices.
  We also deployed other services, e.g., a messaging service, a logging service, etc.
  The infrastructure was used by apps such as Divar classifieds (13M+ active users) and Cafe Bazaar Android marketplace (40M+ active users).
  I was also involved in building a <strong>compute cloud platform</strong> (think Amazon EC2 or DigitalOcean) using virtualization technologies such as Qemu.
  Furthermore, I made contributions to the design of the billing system and designed and led the development of a central authorization and authentication system used by all internal services.
  The company is one of the most successful startups in Iran.
  Before that I worked at <a href="http://aylien.com">Aylien</a>, <a href="http://sariina.com/en">Sariina</a>, and <a href="http://nokia.co.uk/">Nokia</a>.</li>
<li>At the moment, I am exploring <strong>functional programming</strong> using <strong>OCaml</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<!--
- I help companies build scalable, highly available microservices.
- I am passionate about growing (as opposed to "building") software, functioning prototypes, pair programming, and data-oriented programming.
- I am interested in software development methodologies, designing distributed systems, concurrent systems
  (e.g., [CSP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communicating_sequential_processes)) and bio-inspired algorithms, e.g., Genetic Programming.
