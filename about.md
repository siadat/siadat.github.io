### About me

- I am a Software Engineer at the NoSQL Database Reliability Engineer team at [Yelp](https://www.yelp.co.uk/).
  We manage about 60 Cassandra clusters on Kubernetes using our custom built operator (written in Go).
  Before that I was a techlead at [Alibaba Travels](https://www.alibaba.ir/).
- As a backend engineer, I have worked on highly concurrent messaging systems, financial and payment systems,
  lottery campaigns, authorization systems, highly responsive game servers, and other APIs.
  I use languages such as Go, C++, OCaml, Ruby, and tools like Kubernetes, Docker, Kafka, Qemu, etc.
- As a frontend engineer, I have developed an interactive interface for [Navad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navad).
  The app was used and broadcast live on national television during all the World Cup and derby football matches.
  I have also developed several mobile games and progressive web apps.
  Technologies I have used include Typescript, Flutter, Lua and my custom-built game engine.
- Previously, I worked as an infrastructure engineer at [Cafe Bazaar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cafe_Bazaar).
  I was involved in building the on-premises Kubernetes infrastructure and migrating existing services to microservices.
  We also deployed other services, e.g., a messaging service, a logging service, etc.
  The infrastructure was used by apps such as Divar classifieds (13M+ active users) and Cafe Bazaar Android marketplace (40M+ active users).
  I was also involved in building a compute cloud platform (think Amazon EC2 or DigitalOcean) using virtualization technologies such as Qemu.
  Furthermore, I made contributions to the design of the billing system and designed and led the development of a central authorization and authentication system used by all internal services.
  The company is one of the most successful startups in Iran.
  Before that I worked at [Aylien](http://aylien.com), [Sariina](http://sariina.com/en), and [Nokia](http://nokia.co.uk/).
