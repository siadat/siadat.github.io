  - I am freelance software engineer and consultant.
  - I help companies grow scalable, highly available microservices with high quality tested code.
  - I teach the [Go programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(programming_language)) to developers at companies
    and researchers at universities. I have made a number of contributions to the language.
  - As a backend engineer, I have worked on highly concurrent messaging systems, financial and payment systems,
    lottery campaigns, authorization systems, highly responsive game servers, and other APIs.
    I use languages such as Go, C++, Ruby, and tools like Kubernetes, Docker, Kafka, Qemu, etc.
  - As a frontend engineer, I have developed the interactive interface for [Navad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navad).
    The app was used and broadcast **live on national television** several times during the most watched football matches e.g., the World Cup and derbies.
    I have also developed several mobile games and progressive web apps.
    Technologies I have used include JavaScript, [Flutter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flutter_(software)), Lua and my custom-built game engine.
  - Previously, I worked as an infrastructure engineer at [Cafe Bazaar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cafe_Bazaar).
    I was involved in building the **on-premises Kubernetes** infrastructure and migrating existing services to microservices.
    We also deployed other services, e.g., a messaging service, a logging service, etc.
    The infrastructure was used by apps such as Divar classifieds (13M+ active users) and Cafebazaar Android marketplace (40M+ active users).
    I was also involved in building a **compute cloud platform** (think Amazon EC2 or DigitalOcean) using virtualization technologies such as Qemu.
    Furthermore, I made contribution in the design of the billing system and **designed and led the development of a centeral authorization and authentication system used by all internal services**.
    The company is one of the most successful startups in Iran.
    Before that I worked at [Aylien](http://aylien.com), [Sariina](http://sariina.com/en) and [Nokia](http://nokia.co.uk/).

  - I am interested in software development methodologies, designing distributed systems, concurrent systems
    (e.g., [CSP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communicating_sequential_processes)) and bio-inspired algorithms, e.g., Genetic Programming.
